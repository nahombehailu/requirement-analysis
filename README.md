Requirement Analysis in Software Development
Introduction
This repository contains documentation and analysis related to the Requirement Analysis phase of software development. It outlines key concepts, activities, and diagrams for understanding how requirements shape the design and success of software projects—specifically within the context of a booking management system.

What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a crucial phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the project team identifies, gathers, and defines what a software system should do. It serves as a foundation for designing, developing, and testing the system.

It involves understanding stakeholder needs, converting those into clear technical requirements, and ensuring all project participants are aligned on what is to be built. This process minimizes misunderstandings and costly rework later in the project lifecycle.

Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Reduces Development Errors: Clear requirements help prevent misunderstandings, reducing bugs and unnecessary rework.

Improves Stakeholder Communication: Ensures all stakeholders have a shared understanding of goals and deliverables.

Defines Project Scope: Sets boundaries for what will (and won’t) be built, helping to prevent scope creep and project delays.

Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
Requirement Gathering: Collect raw requirements from stakeholders using interviews, surveys, and existing documentation.

Requirement Elicitation: Clarify and refine gathered requirements through discussions, workshops, or prototyping.

Requirement Documentation: Write detailed, structured documentation such as Software Requirement Specifications (SRS).

Requirement Analysis and Modeling: Analyze the feasibility, consistency, and completeness of requirements; model use cases and interactions.

Requirement Validation: Review and confirm that requirements are correct, complete, and meet stakeholder expectations.

Types of Requirements
Functional Requirements
These define what the system should do.

Examples for a Booking Management System:

Users can search for available properties.

Users can create, update, or cancel a booking.

Admin can add or remove listings.

Users receive confirmation emails after booking.

Non-functional Requirements
These define how the system should behave.

Examples:

The system should load search results within 2 seconds.

The platform should support up to 10,000 simultaneous users.

The system must be available 99.9% of the time.

All user data must be encrypted in transit and at rest.

Use Case Diagrams
Use Case Diagrams are a visual representation of how users (actors) interact with a system. They help stakeholders understand the functionalities of a system and how different users engage with those functions.


Acceptance Criteria
Acceptance Criteria define the conditions that must be met for a feature to be considered complete and acceptable by stakeholders. They ensure that development aligns with the user's needs and business goals.

Example – Checkout Feature:

User must be logged in to proceed to checkout.

Selected dates and property information must be pre-filled.

User must be able to input payment information securely.

A confirmation message should be displayed after successful booking.

An email confirmation is sent to the user within 2 minutes.
